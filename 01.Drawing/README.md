For this mini project we had to create a drawing using different shapes made with code. 
I found it quite challenging to begin with as i was struggling with how to navigate the new software because it is my first time using it but i eventually figured it out in the end and managed to create the drawing using the code.
I found the coding experience quite good in the end as i enjoyed learning it even though it was quite frustrating at times.
